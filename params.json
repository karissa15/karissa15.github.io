  "body": "It’s great to meet you! My name is Karissa. I live in Baguio City, in the Philippines. I have a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from Pines City Colleges.  I studied nursing because I wanted to take care of my grandparents and parents. I like to listening to music, watching movies and cooking during my free time; my favorite movie is Captain America and my favorite song is All We Know by The Chainsmokers. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve worked in sales and customer support for Interface Technology Incorporated and Convergys for three years, but I have worked as a virtual assistant now for 8 months.  While working at ITI, I worked on outbound calling for selling diabetic supplies and medicines, and while working at Convergys I worked for Ebay as a customer service representative and Citi Sears as a collector.\r\n\r\n\r\nI really like working online as a virtual assistant, because it helps me to grow and I learn new things. I’m looking forward to helping you with your project!",

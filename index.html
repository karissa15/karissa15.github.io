          <p>It’s great to meet you! My name is Karissa. I live in Baguio City, in the Philippines. I have a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from Pines City Colleges.  I studied nursing because I wanted to take care of my grandparents and parents. I like to listening to music, watching movies and cooking during my free time; my favorite movie is Captain America and my favorite song is All We Know by The Chainsmokers. </p>

<p>I’ve worked in sales and customer support for Interface Technology Incorporated and Convergys for three years, but I have worked as a virtual assistant now for 8 months.  While working at ITI, I worked on outbound calling for selling diabetic supplies and medicines, and while working at Convergys I worked for Ebay as a customer service representative and Citi Sears as a collector.</p>

<p>I really like working online as a virtual assistant, because it helps me to grow and I learn new things. I’m looking forward to helping you with your project!</p>
